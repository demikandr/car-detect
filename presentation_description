1) Intro, small talk on task
2) Approaches (for detection and tracking)
3) Benchmark (KITTI)
4) Paper I based my work on (efficient online segmentation) and its problems: merged objects, small range
5) My approach + distance euristic + dimensions heuristic)
5) Current results (visualization in rviz)
6) future work (find baseline, check on kitti benchmark, time efficiency optimization)
